# Alternative APK Build Methods

Since Gradle builds are having issues, here are alternative ways to generate the APK:

## Method 1: Using Android SDK Build Tools Directly (Advanced)

This method uses Android SDK's command-line tools directly without Gradle.

## Method 2: Online Build Services (Easiest)

Use cloud-based build services that don't require local setup.

## Method 3: Simplified Gradle Wrapper Script

A more robust build script with better error handling.

## Method 4: Pre-compiled APK Template

Use a pre-built template and just modify the package name/URL.

Let me create these alternatives for you.
